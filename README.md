To change map open map1 (0 for ground and 1 for walls)

You can move red tank with WASD and C for shoot

And you can move blue with IJKL and >(next to ?) for shoot


there is a bug that when you shoot perpendicular to bottom of walls it goes through(I might fix it but that project is over now :( I want to do new projects)
Also, you can see I have a class in my TankGame Class. Well, being a noobie in my first project is normal :D
