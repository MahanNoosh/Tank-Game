# Tank-Game

A classic two-player tank battle game built as my grade 11 final project.  
While it has some minor bugs, it's still fun to play and worth showcasing.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- **Red Tank Controls:**
  - Move: `WASD`
  - Shoot: `C`

- **Blue Tank Controls:**
  - Move: `IJKL`
  - Shoot: `>` (next to `?`)

To change the map, open `map1` and edit the values: `0` for ground and `1` for walls.

## 🛠️ Known Issues

- When shooting perpendicular to the bottom of walls, bullets may pass through them.
- Some code structure issues due to being a beginner at the time.

## 📂 Project Structure

The main game logic is contained within the `TankGame` class.  
Despite being my first big project in java, it was a valuable learning experience especially at the time where there was no AI helping us.
